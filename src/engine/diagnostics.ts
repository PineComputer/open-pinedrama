// What a maker sends Pine when the studio misbehaves (Settings, Troubleshooting): the app and
// its Pine project, never the key; every drama down to its Computers, sessions, turns and
// reviews, with Pine's ids and the errors they met; what the agents said lately; and the
// engine's log. No files and no sealed values. Pine's ids are what match its own logs to
// the studio's.
